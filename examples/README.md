# Examples

This direcory hopes to provide examples that are in the wasm_bindgen codebase. Rewritten hopefully to be a little simpler.
Each directory also contains a
`build.sh` which assembles all the relevant files locally. If you open up
`index.html` in a web browser you should be able to see everything in action
when using `build.sh`!

The examples here are:

* `dom` - an example of accessing the global `document` object and appending
  HTML to it
